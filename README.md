# dogAlert
A .NET Core application to assist in judging wether or not you should leave your dogs outside in your backyard while you are away(at work?)

Developed for my own selfish need of not needing to check the weather every morning before leaving for work if its safe to leave my dogs outside. I constantly was worried over weird temperature changes or sudden heavy rain. I found an API that would track the data over hours and started dreaming up a way to then send it to myself in the morning.
